Run all experiments from a container.I have come across many developers who face serious issues when it comes to installing tensorflow on a linux distro such as Ubuntu. There are very few instances when the installation goes smoothly the first time itself. Mostly, the developer has to face a plethora of error messages which get quite tricky to solve. Some of the error messages are shown below: [...\\stream_executor\\dso_loader.cc] Couldn&apos;t open CUDA library nvcuda.dll [...\\stream_executor\\cuda\\cuda_dnn.cc] Unable to load cuDNN DSOSimilar error messages can be found in this official tensorflow link → https://www.tensorflow.org/install/errors Let’s make things easier and lives simpler: Enter Docker:Using Docker containers the life of a developer becomes easier by a massive amount. Many developers shy away from using docker containers thinking that it introduces extra dependencies into the system followed by maintenance issues, but that’s a misconception. Docker containers actually reduce the time spent on figuring out different library versions to be installed and how they would communicate with one another. Containers solve multiple issues which arise with incompatibility of libraries and version mismatch. A container is completely independent from it’s host and reduces the chances of ruining environments on the host machine Installing Docker and NVIDIA Docker :In order to run tensorflow as a container we would obviously need the latest version of docker to be installed and configured. Along with that we would also need NVIDIA Docker v2 to be installed on the host machine. NVIDIA Docker plays a beautiful role of exposing the host machine’s GPU and GPU drivers to a container. Hence the developer only has to worry about installing the correct NVIDIA GPU driver on this machine. The NVIDIA Docker v2 does the task of making it available for the container. In order to learn how to install the latest version of Docker and NVIDIA Docker v2 , head over to my earlier post which describes this is in detail. Link given below: Deep Learning for Production: Deploying YOLO using Docker. Installing tensorflow using Docker:Once your docker and NVIDIA docker v2 installation is complete with nvidia-smi giving you the output as shown in Fig 1, when run inside a docker container, we can move ahead with pulling the correct image for tensorflow. Simply doing a docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow would download the latest version of tensorflow image. This can be run using the following command docker run -it -rm --runtime=nvidia --name=tensorflow_container ***tensorflow_image_name***Executing the command given above will run the tensorflow container in an interactive shell along with the availability of the NVIDIA gpus inside the container. Now there are certain modifications which can be performed to get the tensorflow version required along with other libraries. Let’s say you want the latest version of tensorflow along with gpu support and python 3 pre-installed. The image for this customization can be easily pulled using the following command: docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu-py3You can find many other such images in the following link →https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/tags Just do a docker pull on the one which suits your requirement. If you want other libraries along with tensorflow, you can put them in a dockerfile and perform build command. Fig 2 above shows a custom dockerfile with tensorflow v1 image being used along with installation of other libraries such as OpenCV,Moviepy,Keras and Apache Kafka for python Once inside the container invoked using docker run, you can setup code to use tensorflow easily as you would done on the host machine without the container. I would encourage all AI/ML practitioners to increase the use of docker containers to increase their research and development efficiency by reducing the time spent in managing multiple libraries and dueling with incompatibility errors.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Python and Kafka: message passing and more","slug":"Pyton-and-Kafka-Message-Passing-and-More","date":"2020-05-03T14:50:04.000Z","updated":"2020-05-04T14:16:16.933Z","comments":true,"path":"/2020/05/03/Pyton-and-Kafka-Message-Passing-and-More/","link":"","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/2020/05/03/Pyton-and-Kafka-Message-Passing-and-More/","excerpt":"","text":"Python and Kafka: message passing and moreAt many stages during a developer’s career, he/she has to build systems capable of communicating with another. For example, there may be two python programs and the second program’s operations might depend on the output of the first program. There can be multiple programs in that linear sequence, with every consecutive program depending on the output of the previous. The linear sequence may even branch out to two child programs depending on the output of the previous. An example dependency graph is shown below. As shown in Fig 1, program 2 depends on the output of program 1. Similarly, program 3 depends on the output of program 2. Program 3, in turn, branched out into two children programs accepting output from 3. If the objective of the developer is to make program 4 and program 5 run in parallel then he/she will have to make asynchronous calls to these programs in a multi-threaded fashion. Since python is not inherently thread safe, making scalable multi-threaded systems becomes a bit difficult. This is where Apache Kafka can be used. Let me give you brief introduction of Apache Kafka before moving into it’s implementation and integration with Python. A software platform developed by LinkedIn, Kafka *is an open-source stream processing pipeline which was later donated to the *Apache Software foundation. As mentioned on the official Apache site, Kafka can be used for creating data pipelines that are horizontally scalable, extremely fast and fault-tolerant. The use-case involving python programs given above is not an exact streaming pipeline but Kafka can be used to solve the problem of sending messages to programs for execution and can be also be used to horizontally scale the information between programs. Let’s move forward to see how this can be done. 1. Installing Kafka on Ubuntu and Confluent-Kafka for python:In order to install Kafka, just follow **this** installation tutorial for Ubuntu 18 given on **DigitalOcean**. ***Confluent-Kafka*** is a fully managed enterprise platform for Kafka services. Confluent also ships a Python Client for Kafka, which can be used to integrate Kafka directly with python. This client can be used to create topics, delete them and also send and receive messages. 2. Using Kafka with python:Let’s begin my making a project folder. We will be carrying out the experiments using Docker since it’s a wonderful piece of technology and makes a developer’s life extremely easy. A good practice would be to have two project folders, but for this experiment would be using just one. To execute the python programs we will be going inside the containers and running and them manually. If you want a pretty tutorial on using Docker with python checkout these blogs -&gt; **Docker and Tensorflow and also Docker and YOLO** Let’s go ahead and check each of these files now. Config.yml : *Contains the topic list and from which the two programs are going to read. Also contains the broker information. A kafka topic retains a certain message for a certain amount of topic. Kafka topics can be also be broken down into partitions. Users can then send specific messages in these partitions. To understand more about Kafka topics and partitions check this link out -&gt; [Kafka topics and partitions](http://cloudurable.com/blog/kafka-architecture-topics/index.html) . ***A Kafka consumer reads messages from a particular topic and the Kafka produces/sends messages to topics. KafaConsumer.py and KafkaProducer.py : **These two files contains the classes for the *Kafka Consumer* and *Kafka Producer.* For complete information please refer to the [*github repo](https://github.com/AbhishekBose/kafka_python). Link given below. These two files contains classes which have been created using the *Consumer and Producer classes from the confluent_kafka library.main(operation,x,y) Dockerfile: *Contains the configuration for the docker container which we will be spawning. This will take a *python:3.8 image and install all required libraries using the requirements.txt file. The project folder is added to container using the *ADD *command as shown in Fig 4 below. *Requirements.txt *: Contains a list of all the python libraries for this project python_1.py : *This file does the task of sending a message to a topic which will be read by the second python code. The *config file is read using the *PyYaml library. *The function , defined as *main(operation,x,y) *initializes the producer object named prod and sends a message to it. The message is in a json format which can be read the second program. In this example the second function would be performing two operations namely addition and subtraction. The operations and the operators are taken as command line arguments. python_2.py: *This code essentially will contain the consumer. The consumer will read from the topic in which *python_1.py **will be producing the message. The two functions are defined as *add(x,y) *and *subtract(x,y). These functions will be receiving the two operators to perform the operation on, shown in Fig 6.1. The main function defined in Fig 6.2 is while loop which continuously reads from the consumer topic. This function checks the *operation which was sent by the previous code by reading the message in a json format and calls the respective function. If the operator in the message is sum then the add function is called otherwise the subtract function is called. 3. Building the image and running the container:In order to build the image type the command: docker build -t &apos;image_name&apos; .Once the image is built, spawn a container by typing the following command: docker run -it -d --name=container_name --network=host image_name4. Executing the programs:Go inside the container by typing the following command: docker exec -it container_name bashThis will get you inside. The above container opens up the bash shell inside the container. Run the following commands in two separate shells to witness the output Run the consumer first cd src python python2.py 0The 0 here is the client id which gives a name to your consumer. You can have multiple consumers reading from the consumer topic. This ensures parallel processing as shown in Fig 7.1. Just assign a different client id to each consumer. Now execute the producer by : python python1.py 5 2 sumThe operation here is sum and the operators are 5 and 2 (Fig 7.2) The output can be immediately seen with the result of the addition operation on the previously shell as shown in Fig 7.3 5. Conclusion:This project was a basic example how Kafka can be extensively used for creating massive, parallel data pipelines. At **NAYAN Technologies** we use Kafka extensively for our deep learning inference and training data pipelines.

When the user zooms out, the markers gather together into clusters, to make viewing the map easier.If you have a lot of markers on the map, it’s better to use Marker Cluster setting to organize them better visually. Why marker clustering?The marker clustering utility helps you manage large number of google markers at different zoom levels. To be precise, the ‘markers’ are actually ‘items’ at this point, and only become ‘Markers’ when they’re rendered. Rendering large number of google markers on google map can be very resouce extensive tasks and UI experince is also not good even if we achieve to render them. When a user views the map at a high zoom level, the individual markers show on the map. When the user zooms out, the markers gather together into clusters, to make viewing the map easier. How marker clustering worksThe MarkerClustererPlus library uses the grid-based clustering technique that divides the map into squares of a certain size (the size changes at each zoom level), and groups the markers into each square grid. It creates a cluster at a particular marker, and adds markers that are in its bounds to the cluster. It repeats this process until all markers are allocated to the closest grid-based marker clusters based on the map’s zoom level. If markers are in the bounds of more than one existing cluster, the Maps JavaScript API determines the marker’s distance from each cluster, and adds it to the closest cluster.

May be most of us (mostly college students) still have the same problem. So today in this post I will show you how to integrate a Flask application with PyMongo. What is PyMongo? As according to its official site,“PyMongo is a Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB, and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from Python”. The PyMongo is very easy to use and quite easy to integrate with Flask. For this you must have install MongoDb in your machine. Let’s get started. If you are new to flask then before diving more into it, I highly recommend to check out my previous post in which I discussed about how to create your first application. Firstly we will write some basic files for the project before heading towards the main backend logic. Firstly we write the run.py file and write the code to start our flask server from labeler import app as application from labeler import config application.config.from_object(config) application.config.from_pyfile(&apos;config/config.py&apos;) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: application.run(host=&apos;0.0.0.0&apos;, port=8000)Now, write the init.py from flask import Flask from flask_bootstrap import Bootstrap app = Flask(__name__) Bootstrap(app) from labeler import routesNow make a settings.py file inside the config folder and write the below code in it. import pymongo from pymongo import MongoClient ENV = &quot;test&quot; if ENV.lower() == &quot;production&quot;: MONGO_DB_NAME = &apos;image_search&apos; MONGO_DB_URL = &apos;localhost&apos; else: MONGO_DB_NAME = &apos;image_search_local&apos; MONGO_DB_URL = &apos;localhost&apos; CLIENT = MongoClient() CLIENT = MongoClient(MONGO_DB_URL, 27017) DB = CLIENT[MONGO_DB_NAME]In this script, we simple configure our mongo database and connect pymongo with the DB. Now, its time to make a script for mongo queries. Lets create a mongo.py file inside mongodb folder and write the below lines in it. import pymongo from pymongo import MongoClient import sys from labeler.config.settings import DB class settingupDb: def __init__(self, query, coll_name): self.query = query self.coll_name = coll_name def constructDb(self): self.coll = DB[self.coll_name] return self.coll def insertsToDb(self,db,coll,query): self.post_id = coll.insert(self.query, check_keys=False) print(&apos;Data inserted for Object ID:: &apos;,self.post_id) def updatesInfo(self, db, coll, query, newVal): self.query = query self.newVal = newVal self.updatedColl = coll.update_many(self.query, self.newVal) def fetchInfo(self, db, coll, query): self.results = coll.find(query) return self.results def aggregateQuery(self, db, coll, query_in_list): self.results = coll.aggregate(query_in_list) return self.results def insertData(query, collection): c_db = settingupDb(query, collection) coll = c_db.constructDb() c_db.insertsToDb(DB, coll, query) def fetchData(collection, query): c_db = settingupDb(query, collection) coll = c_db.constructDb() res = c_db.fetchInfo(DB, coll, query) return res def groupingData(collection, query): c_db = settingupDb(query, collection) coll = c_db.constructDb() res = c_db.aggregateQuery(DB, coll, query) return res def updateData(query, newVal, collection): c_db = settingupDb(query, collection) coll = c_db.constructDb() c_db.updatesInfo(DB, coll, query, newVal)In this script, I created a class settingupDb, it basically sets up the db. Then defines some methods based on the queries. In this project we use some basic queries like :- Insert Find Update Aggregate Will explain the use of these queries when we use them in the project. Now lets make our routes.py file. from labeler import app import json import os from werkzeug import secure_filename import flask from flask import render_template from labeler.backend.handle_requests import STATIC_FOLDER = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) + &apos;/static/&apos;Firstly we will import everything in the script. The last line is for the static folder where we server our media files. Since our database is empty, so firstly we will write a Data Insertion endpoint. Now, write a handle_requests.py file inside the backend folder. from labeler.mongodb.mongo import fetchData, insertData COLL = &quot;Image-Data&quot; def isLabelInDb(label, image_path): query = {&quot;label&quot;: label} res = fetchData(COLL, query) alreadyPresent = False if res.count() == 0: insert_q = {&quot;label&quot;: label, &quot;image_path&quot;: image_path} insertData(insert_q, COLL) else: alreadyPresent = True return alreadyPresentThis function deals with the insertion and fetching part. The input is the label and the image. Firstly it checks the given label is already present in the database or not, if the label is not present then it inserts it into the database along with the image and if the label is already there in the database then it sets the “alreadyPresent” flag. Now according to the this logic we write our endpoint in the routes.py file. @app.route(&quot;/createLabels&quot;, methods=[&apos;GET&apos;, &apos;POST&apos;]) def createLabels(): if flask.request.method == &apos;POST&apos;: image = flask.request.files[&apos;image&apos;] label = flask.request.form[&apos;label&apos;] image.save(STATIC_FOLDER + secure_filename(image.filename)) alreadyPresent = isLabelInDb(label, image.filename) if alreadyPresent: message = &quot;The label is already in the database. Try with other label&quot; return render_template(&apos;error.html&apos;, message = message) else: message = &quot;The label is successfully inserted to the database&quot; return render_template(&apos;success.html&apos;, message = message) else: return render_template(&apos;createLabels.html&apos;)This endpoint takes two input for a POST request. The “image” and “label”. It calls the function described above and it renders a template with a message. Now we defines our “home” endpoint. In routes.py write the below code. @app.route(&apos;/home&apos;) def home(): allImages = getAllImages() data = {} if len(list(allImages._CommandCursor__data)) != 0: for r in allImages: label = r[&apos;_id&apos;] images = r[&apos;image_path&apos;] data[label] = images return render_template(&apos;home.html&apos;, results=data)This renders all the images with their function to the home page. Lets create a “getAllImages” function for this code. In the handle_requests.py write below code. def getAllImages(): group_q = {&quot;$group&quot;: {&quot;_id&quot;: &quot;$label&quot;, &quot;image_path&quot;: {&quot;$push&quot;: &quot;$image_path&quot;}}} project_q = {&quot;$project&quot;: {&quot;label&quot;: 1, &quot;image_path&quot;:1}} pipeline = [group_q, project_q] res = groupingData(COLL, pipeline) return resThis function is basically grouping all the data based on the labels name present in the database and all image values associated with that are pushed into an array. Now, we will write a function for fetching of image from database. In the handle_requests.py write the below code. def getRequiredImages(label): query = {&quot;label&quot;: label} res = fetchData(COLL, query) totalImages = [] if res.count() != 0: for i in res: image_name = i[&apos;image_path&apos;] totalImages.append(image_name) return totalImagesThis function fetches all the images from the database for the given label name and returns them as a list. Now lets create its endpoint in the routes.py. @app.route(&apos;/fetchImages&apos;, methods=[&apos;POST&apos;]) def fetchImages(): if flask.request.method == &apos;POST&apos;: label = flask.request.form[&apos;label&apos;] totalImages = getRequiredImages(label) if len(totalImages) == 0: message = &quot;No image is present in the database with the label &quot; + str(label) return render_template(&apos;error.html&apos;, message = message) else: data = [totalImages, label] return render_template(&apos;show_images.html&apos;, results=data)This endpoint takes a label name as input and fetches its images from the database and renders the image on the template. Now the last type of operation left is UPDATE. For this write the below code in handle_requests.py. def updateInfo(image_path, curr_label, new_label): curr_label_q = {&quot;label&quot;: curr_label} new_label_q = {&quot;$set&quot;: {&quot;label&quot;: new_label}} updateData(curr_label_q, new_label_q, COLL)This function takes three input :- the image name the current label name the new label name Now its corresponding endpoint in the routes.py @app.route(&apos;/updateLabel&apos;, methods=[&apos;POST&apos;]) def updateLabel(): if flask.request.method == &apos;POST&apos;: image = flask.request.form[&apos;image&apos;] curr_value = flask.request.form[&apos;current_label&apos;] new_value = flask.request.form[&apos;new_label&apos;] updateInfo(image, curr_value, new_value) message = &quot;Label is updated !!&quot; return render_template(&apos;success.html&apos;, message=message)This endpoint shows a message after successful updation of labels Conclusion This is the very basic application which is made by integrating flask with pymongo. The code is available on github. The necessary templates are also uploaded there.","categories":[],"tags":[],"author":"Himanshu Garg"},{"title":"App-Heartbeat","slug":"App-Heartbeat","date":"2020-02-03T13:40:48.000Z","updated":"2020-05-04T14:16:16.929Z","comments":true,"path":"/2020/02/03/App-Heartbeat/","link":"","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/2020/02/03/App-Heartbeat/","excerpt":"","text":"This is an era of mobile technology where everyone is a smartphone user. To be able to use a smartphone we need to ‘Interact’ with it. A simple touch with a finger to open an app is an example of this ‘interact’ and this phenomenon is called ‘User Interaction’.Heart of application will continue beat, as long as user interact. Heartbeat is used to calculate sessions, for how much time a user is interacted with application. When a user is started using app, we create a session. A session has two values, start time and end time. For a new session both start and end time will same (current time of system). Every one minute, we check, is user interacted or not. If user is interacted then we update that session by changing its end time (now end time for that session will be current time of system). If user is not interacted then we create a new session. Reason behind to create a heartbeat of application , we will have at least 60 seconds lost. Let’s get startedCreate a modelIn that data class, we will handle some sessions related tasks (check session is active or not, update session etc.). A session will have two values start time and end time. 1234data class Session( val startTime: Long, var endTime: Long ) We perform some operations in session - - Is session active :In that we check current session is active or not.

We have total 10 Numeric and 26Alphabets that sums up the total number of classes in our network to 36. Inorder to get characters from the License Plates we first need to use some kindof License Plate detector which is followed by a Character segmentation methodin order to extract character from the License Plates (LP). Architecture of modelWe have used very familiar CNN network for OCR, usually CNN consists of someConvolution layers(All Convolution layers are followed by max pooling layers)and fully connected layers. We already know much about Convolution layers so i am gonna talk about maxpooling and fully connected layers here. Pooling layers section would reduce the number of parameters when theimages are too large. Spatial pooling also called sub-sampling or down-samplingwhich reduces the dimensionality of each map but retains important information.Spatial pooling can be of different types: Max Pooling Average Pooling Sum Pooling Max pooling takes the largest element from the rectified feature map. Taking thelargest element could also take the average pooling. Sum of all elements in thefeature map call as sum pooling. The layer we call as Fully Connected Layer (FC) layer, we flattened ourmatrix into vector and feed it into a fully connected layer like a neuralnetwork. After the last max pooling layer there will be a sequence of FC layers.Finally we will apply an activation function such as softmax or sigmoid toclassify the outputs between classes. Model configuration is given below: Total layer : 14 Convolution with 64 different filters in size of (3x3) Max Pooling by 2 ReLU activation function Batch Normalization Convolution with 128 different filters in size of (3x3) Max Pooling by 2 ReLU activation function Batch Normalization Convolution with 256 different filters in size of (5x5) Max Pooling by 2 ReLU activation function Batch Normalization Convolution with 512 different filters in size of (5x5) Max Pooling by 2 ReLU activation function Batch Normalization Flattening the 3-D output of the last convolving operations. Fully Connected Layer with 128 units Fully Connected Layer with 256 units Fully Connected Layer with 512 units Fully Connected Layer with 1024 units Fully Connected Layer with 36 units (number of classes) Figure 1. Architecture of model PlaceholdersDefining a placeholder in tensorflow is very common. When we want to declare ourinput and output without initialization this method comes very useful. You canuse them during training of model by feeding them with training data and labels. 12345678910111213def create_placeholders(n_H0, n_W0, n_C0, n_y): X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape = (None, n_H0, n_W0, n_C0), name=&apos;X&apos;) Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape = (None, n_y), name = &apos;Y&apos;) keep_prob = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name=&quot;keep_prob&quot;) return X,Y,keep_prob# X_train contains training data with shape (batch_size,height,widht,channel)# Y_train contains labels of training data with shape (batch_size,num_classes,1)m, n_H0, n_W0, n_C0 = X_train.shapen_y = Y_train.shape[1]X, Y, keep_prob = create_placeholders(n_H0, n_W0, n_C0, n_y) Once you have defined your model architecture you now need to define cost andoptimizer for your model which is defined in the next section. Cost function and optimizerCost function gives degree of error between predicted and expected values andafter that it represent it in form of a real number. Whereas optimizer updatethe weight parameters to minimize the cost function. Finally, you’ll define cost, optimizer, and accuracy. The tf.reduce_meantakes an input tensor to reduce, and the input tensor is the results of certainloss functions between predicted results and ground truths. We have to measureloss over 36 classes, tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logis function isused. When training the network, what you want is minimize the cost by applying aalgorithm of your choice. It could be SGD,AdamOptimizer,AdagradOptimizer orsomething else. You have to study how each algorithm works to choose whatto use, but AdamOptimizer works fine for most cases in general. Please find cost and optimizer sample below: 12345678910111213141516learning_rate = 0.001# X is placeholder you defined in previous sectionZ3 = forward_propagation(X, keep_prob)# Z3 has the model structure# Loss and Optimizercost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=Z3, labels=Y))optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=learning_rate).minimize(cost)# Accuracyy_pred = tf.nn.softmax(Z3)y_pred_class = tf.argmax(y_pred, axis = 1)y_true_class = tf.argmax(Y, axis = 1)correct_prediction = tf.equal(y_pred_class, y_true_class)accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, tf.float32)) ConclusionSo in this post i have explained basic steps to train simple CNN network for anyclassification task i.e. OCR in this particular post. I have given all the stepsexcept the training part for that you just need to use session of tensorflowwhile feeding image data and labels for those images to placeholder you havecreated to the session.run function.","categories":[{"name":"AI","slug":"AI","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/categories/AI/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Deep Learning","slug":"Deep-Learning","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Deep-Learning/"},{"name":"OCR","slug":"OCR","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/OCR/"},{"name":"Character Recognition","slug":"Character-Recognition","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Character-Recognition/"}],"author":"Piyush Jain"},{"title":"Getting Started with Ruby on Rails","slug":"rails-getting-started","date":"2020-01-28T08:00:00.000Z","updated":"2020-05-04T14:16:16.981Z","comments":true,"path":"/2020/01/28/rails-getting-started/","link":"","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/2020/01/28/rails-getting-started/","excerpt":"","text":"We recently inducted a couple of engineers into our Rails team. Both of them had a web frontend experience, but zero experience with Ruby or backend development. Thanks to the simplicity and convention focussed approach of the Rails framework, both of them were writing test driven production grade code within a week! First thing was setting up their machines. We decided to go with Ubuntu 18.04 for the OS RVM as the Ruby version manager RubyMine as the IDE Postgresql as the database RubyFirst step was to get them comfortable with Ruby. We believe that doing is the best way of learning. So we got them to complete the wonderful koans at http://rubykoans.com/ to get hands on practice. An important thing while working in a team is to have consistent coding style across all members. We follow the style guide at https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide , so they read through the guide. RailsWe feel the best guide for Rails is the official guide itself. https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/ The three sections that were assigned were, Getting Started with Rails Models Controllers We skipped the views as we mostly work on API only apps. After this, we covered the Rails style guide https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rails-style-guide . TestsWe use RSpec and FactoryBot internally for writing our tests. For RSpec, the Github page is a good starting point https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails For FactoryBot, we assigned the Getting Started guide on Github https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md Continuing EducationWith these basic tutorials, the engineers were basically ready for contributing to production. Their first few pull requests had many comments, but they came down significantly within the first two weeks. For continuing our Rails education, we keep reading up on the frequent gems that we use, such as devise aasm active_model_serializers pundit resque whenever carrierwave and other excellent gems. ConclusionWe got a pleasant reminder as to why Rails is our favorite framework to work on. Within the first few weeks only the engineers were writing production grade, well tested code.

To do so, follow the steps below: Find the Configurations icon of your Grafana on the left side of your dashbaord. Click Add Datasource Click on Add New Source Choose MySQL and add your databse credentials. Using Data in your panel.To show data from your SQL db to your panel. You need to use it in your panel’s module.ts and frontend page. This example has data integration, if you want to see a code for referral.https://github.com/grafana/piechart-panel To get the data in your panel you need to call your function when queries fetch the data from DB. There are 5 events in a grafana panel which are listed below: 12345this.events.on(&apos;render&apos;, this.onRender.bind(this));this.events.on(&apos;data-received&apos;, this.onDataReceived.bind(this));this.events.on(&apos;data-error&apos;, this.onDataError.bind(this));this.events.on(&apos;data-snapshot-load&apos;, this.onDataReceived.bind(this));this.events.on(&apos;init-edit-mode&apos;, this.onInitEditMode.bind(this)); The only one we need to think about right now is data-received event. This event is called whenever an SQL query is entered in the Query Editor of a panel in Grafana. onDataReceived123456onDataReceived(dataList: any) &#123; console.log(dataList) this.series = dataList.map(this.seriesHandler.bind(this)); this.data = this.parseSeries(this.series); this.render(this.data);&#125; This function is called whenever data is received on panel. Since we bind this in this function. Its own object is sent in this function. dataList contains all the data in this case. You can manipulate and show the data however you want in this function. You can enter any number of queries in the Queries Section of your panel in the dashboard and use them as they are sent in dashboard as an Array output. This is how you use SQL DB in your custom Grafana Panel Tips: You can use $__timeFilter(column_name) to filter the data according to the timestamp provided in Grafana dashboard.

The whole topic is too long to cover in a single blog so we will divide it in two parts Create spark cluster on which we will run multiple instances of the model Run the neural networks on the cluster Lets begin, For creating cluster we will use docker containers and create a common network where they can communicate with each other Lets start with introduction of Docker: Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker(software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))_ Thanks to docker containers we will be able to create several worker nodes on which we can run spark for distributed processing. Docker Installation: Docker installation is very easy just follow the steps in the following link Get Docker Engine - Community for Ubuntu Create Docker image : To create a docker image we need to first create a Dockerfile which upon building will install all the libraries that we want. Sample docker file: 1234567891011121314151617181920FROM nvidia/cuda:10.2-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04MAINTAINER XYZRUN apt-get update -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-dev libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev# addonsRUN \\ apt-get install -y \\ wget \\ unzip \\ ffmpeg \\ gitRUN pip3 install opencv-pythonRUN pip3 install moviepyRUN pip3 install pandasRUN pip3 install requestsRUN pip3 install numbaRUN pip3 install imutilsRUN pip3 install filterpyRUN pip3 install sklearnRUN pip3 install kafka-python Now build the docker image using the following command 1$ docker build -t &quot;my_docker_image&quot; . This will create a docker image with name my_docker_image You can see the list of images by using the following command 1$ docker images You should see your newly created image. Now we are ready to create containers using the above image. Create docker network: Docker network is essential when containers wants to communicate . The most common and default network is bridge. Run the following command to create a network 1$ docker network create &quot;my_network&quot; Run the following command to list all existing networks 1$ docker network ls You should see your newly created networks Now that we have created the network , we can now create containers and bind them with the network that we created. Create docker container: Let’s first create a master node of the cluster Run the following command to create the master docker container 1$ docker run -it --name master-docker --network my_network my_image /bin/sh This command will create the container and attach a shell with the container To check if the docker is running , run the following command to list down all running container 1$ docker ps -a You should see the container master-docker running Now lets create 2 worker nodes The following commands will create two worker nodes with names worker_docker_1 and worker_docker_2 1$ docker run -it --name worker_docker_1 --network my_network my_image /bin/sh 1$ docker run -it --name worker_docker_2 --network my_network my_image /bin/sh Now again check the running container now you will be able to see one master node and 2 worker nodes.

Semantic SegmentationSemantic segmentation is the task of classifying each image pixel to a class label. It is a classification task but at pixel level instead of image level. The labels could include a person, car, flower, piece of furniture, etc. For example, in the below image, all the cars will have the same labels. However, one can differentiate between the same class objects, this is called instance segmentation. For example, in an image that has many cars, instance segmentation can differentiate between each car object. Semantic segmentation has many applications in autonomous vehicles, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), robotics, self-driving cars because it is important to know the context in which the agent operates. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which initially designed for classification tasks, have impressive capabilities in solving complex segmentation tasks as well. Residual layers have created a new trend in ConvNets design. Their reformulation of the convolutional layers to avoid the degradation problem of deep architectures allowed neural networks to achieve very high accuracies with large amounts of layers. Computation resources are key factors in self-driving and autonomous vehicles. Algorithms are not only required to operate reliably, but they are required to operate fast (real-time), fit in embedded devices due to space constraints (compactness), and have low power consumption to affect as minimum as possible the vehicle autonomy. Considering a reasonable amount of layers, enlarging the depth with more convolutions achieves only small gains in accuracy while significantly increasing the required computational resources. Residual LayerThe paper proposes a new architecture design that leverages skip connections and convolutions with 1D kernels. While the skip connections allow the convolutions to learn residual functions that facilitate training, the 1D factorized convolutions allow a significant reduction of the computational costs while retaining a similar accuracy compared to the 2D ones. Residual blocks allow convolutional layers to learn the residual functions. For example, in the above image, x is the input vector and F(X)+x is the output vector of the y vector. F(X) is the residual function to be learned. This residual formulation facilitates learning and significantly reduces the degradation problem present in architectures that stack a large number of layers. Non-bottleneck Residual LayersThere can be two instances of residual layer: the non-bottleneck design with two 3x3 convolutions as depicted in Fig. 1(a), and the bottleneck version as depicted in Fig. 1(b). Both versions have a similar number of parameters and almost equivalent accuracy. However, the bottleneck requires less computational resources and these scale in a more economical way as depth increases. Hence, the bottleneck design has been commonly adopted in state-of-the-art networks. However, it has been reported that non-bottleneck ResNets gain more accuracy from increased depth than the bottleneck versions, which indicates that they are not entirely equivalent and that the bottleneck design still suffers from the degradation problem The paper proposed a new implementation of the residual layer that decomposes 2D convolution into a pair of 1D convolutions to accelerate and reduce the parameters of the original non-bottleneck layer. We refer to this proposed module as “non-bottleneck-1D” (non-bt-1D), which is depicted in Fig. 1(c). This module is faster (as in computation time) and has fewer parameters than the bottleneck design while keeping a learning capacity and accuracy equivalent to the non-bottleneck one. Dilated ConvolutionsDilated convolutions are convolutions applied to input images with gaps. The standard convolution is 1-Dilated convolution. Dilated convolutions other than standard convolutions increase the receptive field of the network. Dilated convolutions are more effective in terms of computational cost and parameters than the convolutions with larger kernel size. The paper proposes a network that uses dilated convolution. Network ArchitectureThe paper presents an encoder-decoder architecture for semantic segmentation. The encoder segment produces downsampled feature maps and the decoder segments upsample the features to match input image resolution.

Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data driven culture. Grafana is a tool that is used to create dashboards. Dashboards consists of Panels which are used to visualize data in many ways. Grafana has many types of panels available to visualize your data in many forms. Such panels include Graphs, Tables, Single stats, etc. But what if you want to use the Grafana but show data in your own format. Grafana allows that as well. These components are known as plugins. In this post we will see how to make our own custom plugin and use it in our Grafana dashboard. Requisites: npm or yarn Git First download the Grafana repo from Grafana websitehttps://grafana.com/grafana/download Then clone Hello World Custom panel with the command written below in the folder data/plugins or var/lib/grafana/plugins. If no such folder exists in root directory create one.Git clone https://github.com/grafana/simple-angular-panel This folder will be created in your data/plugins. Install the dependencies required for that panel using npm install or yarn. Then build the plugin using yarn build or npm run build. (Running the build script defined in package.json) Then start the grafana-server: By running the command ./bin/grafana-server in the root directory of your grafana repo (Linux). By running the grafana-server.exe in bin Folder (Windows). Then panel will be availables in your visualization section when you create a new panel Plugin.jsonIt defines your panel and uniquely identifies it. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&#123;&quot;type&quot;: &quot;panel&quot;,&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Simple Angular&quot;,&quot;id&quot;: &quot;simple-angular-panel&quot;,&quot;info&quot;: &#123;&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Simple Angular Panel&quot;,&quot;author&quot;: &#123;&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Grafana Labs&quot;&#125;,&quot;keywords&quot;: [ &quot;discrete&quot;, &quot;events&quot;, &quot;strings&quot; ],&quot;logos&quot;: &#123;&quot;small&quot;: &quot;img/logo.svg&quot;,&quot;large&quot;: &quot;img/logo.svg&quot;&#125;,&quot;links&quot;: [],&quot;screenshots&quot;: [],&quot;version&quot;: &quot;%VERSION%&quot;,&quot;updated&quot;: &quot;%TODAY%&quot;&#125;,&quot;dependencies&quot;: &#123;&quot;grafanaVersion&quot;: &quot;6.3.x&quot;,&quot;plugins&quot;: [ ]&#125;&#125; “name”: Name Displayed on panel “id”: Unique Identified of your plugin. If two panels have same ID only 1 will be shown “logos”: shows the images shown for your panel which can be found in src/img folder. Module.tsIt is the entry point of your panel. Functions and variables can be created in module.ts and be used In html page using “ctrl” as the object of the class. Front HTML Page.This page can be found at partials/module.html. So if you create a variable named “text” in the SimpleCtrl Class (in module.ts). It can be accessed in HTML page using ““. Options.html page contains the page the visualization section which is shown when you create or edit a panel. After You create your html pages and functionality in module.ts, you can run npm run build or yarn build and use the panel in your own Grafana however you like. Tips : If you want to see changes in your panel while you are creating it. Use npm run watch or yarn watch. It implements changes as you make them. It basically creates build with environment settings as development. You can see the changes by refreshing the webpage.

Let’s go over the basic usage. Installation Install ng2-charts using npm: npm install --save ng2-charts Install Chart.js library: npm install --save chart.js [Options] Then, if you’re using the Angular CLI, you can simply add Chart.js to the list of scripts in your .angular-cli.json file so that it gets bundled with the app: angular-cli.json 123&quot;scripts&quot;: [ &quot;../node_modules/chart.js/dist/Chart.min.js&quot;], APINow you’ll want to import ng2-chart’s ChartsModule into your app module or a feature module: app.module.ts 12345678910111213141516import &#123; BrowserModule &#125; from &apos;@angular/platform-browser&apos;;import &#123; NgModule &#125; from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;import &#123; ChartsModule &#125; from &apos;ng2-charts&apos;;import &#123; AppComponent &#125; from &apos;./app.component&apos;;@NgModule(&#123; declarations: [AppComponent], imports: [ BrowserModule, ChartsModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent]&#125;)export class AppModule &#123;&#125; Usageng2-charts gives us a baseChart directive that can be applied on an HTML canvas element. Here’s an example showing-off some of the options to pass-in as inputs and the chartClick event that’s outputted by the directive: app.component.html 1234567891011&lt;div style=&quot;width: 40%;&quot;&gt; &lt;canvas baseChart [chartType]=&quot;&apos;line&apos;&quot; [datasets]=&quot;chartData&quot; [labels]=&quot;chartLabels&quot; [options]=&quot;chartOptions&quot; [legend]=&quot;true&quot; (chartClick)=&quot;onChartClick($event)&quot;&gt; &lt;/canvas&gt;&lt;/div&gt; And here’s what it can look like in our component class: app.component.ts 1234567891011121314151617181920import &#123; Component &#125; from &apos;@angular/core&apos;;@Component(&#123; ... &#125;)export class AppComponent &#123; chartOptions = &#123; responsive: true &#125;; chartData = [ &#123; data: [330, 600, 260, 700], label: &apos;Account A&apos; &#125;, &#123; data: [120, 455, 100, 340], label: &apos;Account B&apos; &#125;, &#123; data: [45, 67, 800, 500], label: &apos;Account C&apos; &#125; ]; chartLabels = [&apos;January&apos;, &apos;February&apos;, &apos;Mars&apos;, &apos;April&apos;]; onChartClick(event) &#123; console.log(event); &#125;&#125; OptionsHere’s a quick breakdown of the different input options chartType: This sets the base type of the chart. The value can be pie, doughnut, bar, line, polarArea, radar or horizontalBar. legend: A boolean for whether or not a legend should be displayed above the chart. datasets: This should be an array of objects that contain a data array and a label for each data set. data: If your chart is simple and has only one data set, you can use data instead of datasets and pass-in an array of data points. labels: An array of labels for the X-axis. options: An object that contains options for the chart. You can refer to the official Chart.js documentation for details on the available options. In the above example we set the chart to be responsive and adapt depending on the viewport size. colors: Not shown in the above example, but you can define your own colors with the colors input. Pass-in an array of object literals that contain the following value:1234567891011myColors = [ &#123; backgroundColor: &apos;rgba(103, 58, 183, .1)&apos;, borderColor: &apos;rgb(103, 58, 183)&apos;, pointBackgroundColor: &apos;rgb(103, 58, 183)&apos;, pointBorderColor: &apos;#fff&apos;, pointHoverBackgroundColor: &apos;#fff&apos;, pointHoverBorderColor: &apos;rgba(103, 58, 183, .8)&apos; &#125;, ... other colors]; EventsTwo events are emitted, chartClick and chartHover, and they allow to react to the user interacting with the chart. The currently active points and labels are returned as part of the emitted event’s data. chartClick: fires when click on a chart has occurred, returns information regarding active points and labels chartHover: fires when mousemove (hover) on a chart has occurred, returns information regarding active points and labels Updating Datasets Dynamically: Of course, the beauty of Chart.js is that your charts can easily by dynamic and update/respond to data received from a backend or from user input. In the bellow example we add a new data points for the month of May: app.component.ts 1234567891011newDataPoint(dataArr = [100, 100, 100], label) &#123; this.chartData.forEach((dataset, index) =&gt; &#123; this.chartData[index] = Object.assign(&#123;&#125;, this.chartData[index], &#123; data: [...this.chartData[index].data, dataArr[index]] &#125;); &#125;); this.chartLabels = [...this.chartLabels, label];&#125; And it can be used like this: app.component.html 123&lt;button (click)=&quot;newDataPoint([900, 50, 300], &apos;May&apos;)&quot;&gt; Add data point&lt;/button&gt; SchematicsThere are schematics that may be used to generate chart components using Angular CLI. The components are defined in package ng2-charts-schematics. Installation of Schematics Packagenpm instal --save-dev ng2-charts-schematics Example of Generating a Line Chart using Angular CLIng generate ng20chart0schematics:line my-line-chart This calls angular’s component schematics and then modifies the result, so all the options for the component schematic are also usable here. This schematics will also add the ChartsModule as an imported module in the main app module (or another module as specified in the –module command switch).","categories":[{"name":"Web","slug":"Web","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/categories/Web/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Line Chart","slug":"Line-Chart","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Line-Chart/"},{"name":"Javascript","slug":"Javascript","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Javascript/"},{"name":"Data Visualization","slug":"Data-Visualization","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Data-Visualization/"}],"author":"Abhishek Rana"},{"title":"Paytm Gateway Integration","slug":"paytm-gateway-integration","date":"2020-01-02T14:43:06.000Z","updated":"2020-05-04T14:16:16.953Z","comments":true,"path":"/2020/01/02/paytm-gateway-integration/","link":"","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/2020/01/02/paytm-gateway-integration/","excerpt":"","text":"A complete guide on adding payments to your Android app with backend as RoR Steps :- Install SDK Add Static SMS Permission (for SMS autoread) Add Runtime SMS Permission (for SMS autoread) Add Proguard Rules Get Order Checksum from Server (our Server) Generate and send Checksum (from Our Server) Start Payment Transaction Send Payment Response to Server Confirm with Paytm Gateway about payment status Update Order Status Show Order Status on App&nbsp;&nbsp; Step 1: Install SDKAdd the following dependency to your app level build.gradle. 12345678dependencies &#123; ... // Paytm SDK implementation('com.paytm:pgplussdk:1.4.4') &#123; transitive = true &#125;&#125; Step 2: Add Static SMS Permission (for SMS autoread)Add the following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml. 12&lt;uses-permission android:name=”android.permission.READ_SMS”/&gt;&lt;uses-permission android:name=”android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS”/&gt; Step 3: Add Runtime SMS Permission (for SMS autoread)We used Dexter library for handling runtime permissions.

So, today in this post I’ll show you how to setup a basic image-classifier in the form of a web application. Basic requirementsBefore we getting dive more into it, I am listing down the basic ingredients which are required to make a web application in python. Flask Flask Bootstrap Please note that, I am not showing about how to create an AI classifier model, so make sure you have your classifier already before seeking into this post, if not then you can download a pre-trained model. Let’s get started ! InstallationYou need to have installed the above mentioned libraries. You can easily install them by using pip. 12pip install flaskpip install flask-bootstrap Getting startedSo, firstly we arrange our files and folders in the below shown order. You can change the main folder name image-classifier (In my case) to any other name as you like. So, firstly we will write a basic flask app structure in __init__.py. This file can be found inside the classifier. Inside the __init__.py file write the below code 123456from flask import Flaskfrom flask_bootstrap import Bootstrapfrom classifier import routesapp = Flask(__name__) ## defining our flask applicationBootstrap(app) ## giving a nice bootstrap touch to our application Now, writing our run.py file. You can find this run.py file inside the main folder. Open the file and write the below code 123456from classifier import app as applicationapplication.config.from_pyfile(&apos;config/config.py&apos;) if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: application.run(host=&apos;0.0.0.0&apos;, port=8000) ## This tells our ##application will run on this host and on this port. Now, we will create write a config.py file. This file contains the configuration for the application. The basic configuration we can put now is that, we can just put our application in DEBUG mode. So, open the config.py file and write the below line. 123456import osfrom os.path import join, dirname, realpathDEBUG = True## If True, then it refresh the server after making any changes to the code.UPLOAD_FOLDER = join(dirname(realpath(__file__)), &apos;uploaded_images/&apos;) Make a uploaded_images folder inside the config folder, this folder contains the image which will be uploaded on the server via user. Writing a basic route for our flask appWe have completely setup our basic flask environment. Now, its time to write a very basic flask api for hello world. Open the routes.py inside the classifier folder. Add the below lines to it 123456from classifier import appimport flask@app.route(&apos;/testing&apos;)def testing(): return &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello world&lt;/h1&gt;&quot; Here, the route() function of the Flask class is a decorator, which tells the application which URL should call the associated function. 1app.route(rule, options) The rule parameter represents URL binding with the function. The options is a list of parameters to be forwarded to the underlying Rule object. and in the end we just returned a simple message using some HTML tags. To run this code, follows below steps. 12cd path/to/main-folderpython run.py Just open the browser and type localhost:8000/testing. You should see a screen just like below Lets start our main routeLets make our template. For this, firstly makes a folder called template inside the classifier folder. Now inside the template, create a home.html file and paste the code from this link in it. Now, we make our home url and our backend part !!. So we will rewrite our routes.py file 123@app.route(&apos;/home&apos;)def home(): return render_template(&apos;home.html&apos;) ## The template which we created above Now, our image processing function will be like below 123456789101112131415from flask import render_templatefrom werkzeug import secure_filenamefrom classifier.backend.prediction import image_prediction@app.route(&quot;/fetchingImage&quot;, methods = [&apos;POST&apos;])def fetchingImage(): if flask.request.method == &apos;POST&apos; image = flask.request.files[&apos;image&apos;] image.save(app.config[&apos;UPLOAD_FOLDER&apos;] + secure_filename(image.filename)) full_img = app.config[&apos;UPLOAD_FOLDER&apos;] + image.filename data = image_prediction(full_img) if len(data)==2: return render_template(&apos;prediction.html&apos;, results = data) else: return render_template(&apos;error.html&apos;, results = data) Here, firstly we get the image from the form in the home.html, then save the image into the system and then fetch that file and send it to another function image_prediction for processing. Then, we simply render the response from the model to the webpage. If there is no error, then we display the prediction.html template or else, we render the error.html. Now, working on our image_prediction function. For making the this, firstly create a folder named backend inside the classifier folder, then inside the backend folder, create a prediction.py file and write the below code into it. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223import kerasimport numpy as npimport tensorflow as tfimport cv2from keras.models import load_modelfrom keras.applications.vgg19 import VGG19from keras.applications.vgg19 import decode_predictionsdef image_prediction(image): MODEL = VGG19() try: image = cv2.imread(image) image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224)) image = image.reshape((1, image.shape[0], image.shape[1], image.shape[2])) yhat = MODEL.predict(image) label = decode_predictions(yhat) label = label[0][0] label, conf = label[1], label[2]*100 results = [label, conf] except Exception as e: results = &quot;Please check the image.&quot; return results Now, let’s make our error.html and prediction.html templates. These templates are also, saved inside the templates folder. So, you can get the code for both the templates from here. Well the coding part is mostly done, now we will test our web application. Now open your console and run the below command 1python run.py After this, it will firstly download the VGG19 pretrained weights (if you are following my code.), then it will start the server. Now, open the browser and go to localhost:8000/home, you will see something like this Now, click on browse to upload any image and click the predict button. You’ll see some message like this (based on your image) If there is any some issue with your image, then below screen will appear ConclusionSo, this is how we can make a very basic web application for our image classifier. You can also find the whole code from my github.

There is no set guidelines for us to follow. When ever I started thinking of testing my application I always get confused where to start, should I write unit tests or instrumentation tests and should I start with integration and End to end tests. There is also a lot of confusion on frameworks available for android testing.This article has been written in a sense to address this confusion and show us as developers what kind of testing is most preferred and what frameworks are available. Kinds of TestsUnit TestThis is often referred to as local tests and doesn’t require a device or emulator for running them. These can be classified broadly into categories Local/ Pure Unit tests - tests which can run on JVM, mainly written for testing business logic. On android JUnit, Mockito, the mockable Android JARs give us a nice combination of tools to run fast unit-style tests in the local JVM. Android Unit Tests - tests which requires the Android system (ART) and for this we need to replace android dependencies using RoboelectricGuidelines If you have dependencies on the Android framework, particularly those that create complex interactions with the framework, it’s better to include framework dependencies using Robolectric. If your tests have minimal dependencies on the Android framework, or if the tests depend only on your own objects, it’s fine to include mock dependencies using a mocking framework like Mockito and PowerMock. Reference Url : https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests Instrumentation TestsThese tests requires device or an emulator for running. This is mostly used for UI testing but it can be used to test none UI logic as well. This is useful when you need to test code that has a dependency on context. UI tests can be an essential component of any testing strategy since they can uncover issues related to UI, hardware, firmware, and backwards compatibility Reference Url: https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/instrumented-unit-tests Testing FrameworksAndroid X Test Framework It is testing framework and APIs provided by android team for writing unit tests. RoboelectricIt is a framework that brings fast and reliable unit tests to android. Runs inside JVM or your workstation in seconds. This is usually used to Integration testing. Integration tests validate how your code interacts with other parts of the system but without the added complexity of a UI framework. app/src/test/java - for any unit test which can run on the JVM Question : How does it work?Answer : Unlike traditional emulators-based androids tests, it tests run inside a sandbox which allows the android environment to be precisely configured to the desired conditions for each test. It lets you run your tests on your workstation, or on your continuous integration environment in a regular JVM, without an emulator. It handles inflation of views, resource loading, and lots of other stuff that’s implemented in native C code on Android devices. This allows tests to do most things you could do on a real device. It’s easy to provide our own implementation for specific SDK methods too, so you could simulate error conditions or real-world sensor behaviour. It allows a test style that is closer to black box testing, making the tests more effective for refactoring and allowing the tests to focus on the behaviour of the application instead of the implementation of Android Question : Why should be prefer this?Answer : In order for this to run tests it needs regular JVM, Because of this, the dexing, packaging, and installing-on-the emulator steps aren’t necessary, reducing test cycles from minutes to seconds so you can iterate quickly and refactor your code with confidence. Robolectric executes your code against real (not mock) Android JARs in the local JVM. Espresso Use it to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests. These tests are called Instrumentation tests and unlike unit tests takes more time to run them. app/src/androidTest/java - for any instrumentation test which should run on an Android Question : How does it work?Answer : it requires an emulator or a real device to run tests. At the time of execution along with the main application, A testing application is also installed in the device which controls main application automatically. UI AutomatorIt allows us to write cross application functional tests ( End to End) . Example, Sharing messages via Text intent or sending email via locally installed email clients. Monkey Runner CL Monkey is a command line tool which sends pseudo random events to your device. You can restrict Monkey to run only for a certain package and therefore instruct Monkey to test only your application. it can be used for Stress testing for android. Reference Url : https://developer.android.com/studio/test/monkey Recommandations Creating test groups - @SmallTest. @MediumTest and @LargeTest annotation allows us to classify tests. Allows you to run, for example, only short running tests for development cycle. You may run your long running tests on a continuous integration server.This can be easily configured this via InstrumentationTestRunner in user build.gradle (app) We can use a three tiered approach Pure Unit tests : These can be written for our business logic which are completely android independent of API and can run on JVM. These can be written using Junit Framework. Roboelectric Unit tests: where code has only small dependencies on android APIs and can be easily mocked with Roborelectric. Android Instrumentation tests : where code heavily interact with device hardware, sensors and android APIs. These tests will usually take most time to run.","categories":[{"name":"Android","slug":"Android","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/categories/Android/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Instrumentation Test","slug":"Instrumentation-Test","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Instrumentation-Test/"},{"name":"Unit Test","slug":"Unit-Test","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Unit-Test/"},{"name":"Android Testing","slug":"Android-Testing","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/tags/Android-Testing/"}],"author":"Puneet Kashyap"},{"title":"Tracking Deep Learning experiments using Keras,MlFlow and MongoDB","slug":"Tracking-Deep-Learning-Experiments-using-Keras-MlFlow-and-MongoDb","date":"2019-11-29T12:06:56.000Z","updated":"2020-05-04T14:16:16.937Z","comments":true,"path":"/2019/11/29/Tracking-Deep-Learning-Experiments-using-Keras-MlFlow-and-MongoDb/","link":"","permalink":"https://nayan.co/blog/2019/11/29/Tracking-Deep-Learning-Experiments-using-Keras-MlFlow-and-MongoDb/","excerpt":"","text":"It is late 2019 and Deep Learning is not a buzzword anymore. It is significantly used in the technology industry to attain feats of wonders which traditional machine learning and logic based techniques would take a longer time to achieve. The main ingredient in Deep Learning are Neural Networks, which are computation units called neurons, connected in a specific fashion to perform the task of learning and understanding data. When these networks become extremely deep and sophisticated, they are referred to as Deep Neural Networks and thus Deep Learning is performed. Neural Networks are so called because they are speculated to be imitating the human brain in some manner. Though it is not entirely true, but the learning mechanism is mostly similar in nature. A human brain learns about an object or concept when it visually experiences it for a longer amount of time. Similar to that, a neural network learns about objects and what they actually represent when it is fed with a large amount of data. For example, let us consider the LeNet architecture . It is a small two layered CNN (Convolution Neural Network). Convolution Neural Networks are a special kind of neural network where the mathematical computation being done at every layer are convolution operations. If enough images of a certain kind are fed to the LeNet architecture, it starts to understand and classify those images better. That was a simple introduction to what neural networks are and how they behave. In this article we will be mostly looking into three main frameworks which can ease out the developer experience of building these neural networks and tracking there performance efficiently. Nowadays, neural networks are heavily used for classifying objects, predicting data and other similar tasks by many companies out there. When it comes it to training neural networks and keeping track of their performance, the experience is not too subtle. When building a neural network, a developer would be trying out multiple datasets and experimenting with different hyperparameters. It is essential to keep a track a of these parameters and how they affect the output of the neural networks. Also debugging neural networks is an extremely cumbersome task. The output performance of different neural networks may vary due to different reasons. Some of the possible causes maybe inadequate data pre-processing, incorrect optimizer, a learning rate which is too low or too high. The number of variables which affect the performance of a neural network are quite a few. Hence it is essential that every parameter is properly tracked and maintained. Some of the available options present out there include the infamous *Tensorboard, Bokeh *to name a few. In this project we will be using MlFlow ,an open source platform to manage the entire deep learning development cycle. MlFlow allows developers to log and track the outputs of every experiment performed with great precision. We will be looking into MlFlow’s components with more detail in the subsequent sections. The framework we would be using for writing our neural networks and training them is Keras. We will be using the FashionMNIST dataset. It contains a total of 70000 gray scale images (training:test = 60000:10000) , each scaled at 28x28 associated with one from 10 classes. (Fig 1) The folder structure of our project looks as shown in Fig 2 below. The data folder contains our fashion mnist dataset files which will be used for training the model. The db folder contains the python driver code to perform operations on MongoDb collections. MongoDB is an extremely easy to use NoSql database which has been built keeping in developer satisfaction. It is easily integrable with modern day applications and has a large developer community contributing to it’s extensions regularly. The model folder contains piece of code with the neural network model definition. The mlruns folder is created automatically once *mlflow *is invoked in the main code. The aim of the project is to track multiple deep learning experiments and check how the outputs are affected when parameters are changed and data is changed. Since we have only one dataset, we will split it into equal parts in order to simulate a multiple dataset scenario. Let’s start off with the create_dataset script, which is used to split the fashion mnist into equal parts and store them inside the data folder with proper serial number. In Fig 3 shown below, we import fashion mnist from *keras.datasets *and perform the necessary normalization step Next, we write the methods to split the dataset into equal parts and save them with proper incremental serial numbers inside the data folder, inside the root project directory (Fig 4) equal parts for training* After this we go ahead and write the necessary driver code to manage our newly created dataset using MongoDb. Some might say that using MongoDb for such a small project might be an overkill, but personally I find MongoDb to be an excellent tool for managing data with flexibility. Given NoSql’s schema-less nature, managing collections and documents is a breeze. The ease with which any document can be edited in MongoDB is superb. The best part is, whenever a collection is queried , the result returned is a *json *making it extremely easy to be parsed using any programming language. Aggregation queries in mongo are also very simple and allows users to cross reference collections in a swift manner. In order to connect our python scripts with MongoDb we will be using pymongo which can be easily installed using the pip install pymongo. To install MongoDb, follow this tutorial ***https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/*** Once MongoDb is installed and tested to be running properly on your system, create a new database called fashion_mnist. Inside the database create a new collection named dataset as shown in Fig 5 below. A great GUI to interact with MongoDb is robo3t. It’s free and easy to use. It can be downloaded from the following link ***https://robomongo.org/download.***Since our DB is setup and datasets are created, we can progress with the task of inserting necessary information into the dataset collection In Fig 6 shown above, we are importing MongoClient from the pymongo library which will essentially be used to connect to our mongoDB database. Fig 7 below describes mongoQueue class which has been written in order to interact with our dataset collection. In line 18 and 19, the collection name is initialized, which is used in all the member functions. The Enqueue* method in line 6 is used to insert dataset information into the dataset collection. The *Dequeue method in line 10 fetches the first dataset which has a status field of ‘Not** *Processed’.* The setAsProcessing* and setAsProcessed *methods are used to set the status field of respective dataset documents in the collection. Fig 8: Methods to insert data into MongoDB We use the insert_into_db method shown in Fig 8, line 1, to insert information about our newly created datasets into our mongoDb dataset collection. In line 23 of the main function, we iterate over the dataset folder and call *insert_into_db *to insert the necessary information for that dataset into the collection. Once every dataset is successfully inserted into the collection, the fields appear as shown in Fig 9 below. We can now define our model for training our deep learning network. Inside *model/model.py we import all necessary **keras*** packages to build our CNN network (shown in Fig 10a) Fig 10b shows the model architecture. It is a simple two layer CNN, with two MaxPool layers and RelU activation in between. Two Dense layers are also added with 32 and 10 neurons respectively. I have also added a Dropout of 0.5 before the last Dense layer. Now, in our train.py script we import all the necessary modules needed from the keras library to get on with our training. Along with all the keras libraries we import *mlflow *as well (Fig 11) All the hyperparameters which will be used for training is stored in a config file named as train_config.json. This file is read (Fig 12a) and used for defining training parameters In Fig 12b, we have defined out training function , which takes arguments *trainX (our training set) ,*trainY** (*training set labels) and the **model** *(CNN model) From line 38 (In Fig 13), the main function starts where we define our *MongoQueue object using the **MongoQueue** class defined inside script mentioned before, **db_ops.py . *As it can be seen in line 41, *mq*** is our object. In line 42 (Fig 13) , a new CNN model is created by calling the *model function which accepts the optimizer type as input. In this experiment we would be using the ‘*SGD’ (Stochastic Gradient Descent**) to train the network . Everytime we invoke mlflow in our training code for logging, it is known as an mlflow run. MlFlow provides us with an API for starting and managing MlFlow runs. For example, Fig 14a and 14b In our code we start the mlflow run using the python context manager as shown in Fig 14b. At line 46 in Fig 13, we define our our mlflow run with the run name as ‘fashion mnist’.* All data and metrics will be logged under this run name on the **mlflow*** dashboard. From line 47 we start a while loop, which continuously invokes the *dequeue function from the *MongoQeueue** class. What this does is fetches every row corresponding to a particular dataset from the dataset collection which has a status field = *Not Processed (Fig 9). As soon as this dataset is fetched, *setAsProcessing* function is called in line 51 which sets the status of that dataset to *Processing *in *MongoDb. This enables us to understand which dataset is currently being trained by our system. This is particularly helpful is large systems where there are multiple datasets and many training instances running in parallel. In lines 54 and 55, the datasets are loaded from the *data folder corresponding to the **dataset_id** *fetched from the db. Lines 57 and 58 loads the test sets and the training is started at line 59 by calling the *train *function. We then use the trained model to predict our scores as shown in line 60 in Fig 15. The training output looks as shown below (Fig 16a and Fig 16b) As shown in Fig 16b, the training happens for an epoch and the evaluation metrics for the test dataset gets logged. All outputs of the evaluation done using our trained model can be logged using the MlFlow tracking api (as shown in Fig 17). The tracking API comes with functions such as log_param and log_metric which enables us to log every hyperparameter and output values into mlflow. The best feature about mlflow is the dashboard it provides. It has a very intuitive UI and can be used efficiently for tracking our experiments. The dashboard can be started easily by simply hitting *mlflow ui *in your terminal as shown in Fig 18 below. To access the dashboard, just type ***http://localhost:5000** *in your browser and hit enter. Fig 19 shows how the dashboard looks like. Each MlFlow run is logged using a run ID and a run name. The Parameters and the Metrics column log display the parameters and the metrics which were logged while we were training our model Further clicking on a particular run, takes us to another page where we can display all information about our run (Fig 20) MlFlow provides us with this amazing feature to generate plots for our results. As you can see in Fig 21a, the test accuracy change can be visualized across different training datasets and time. We can also choose to display other metrics such as the eval loss, as shown in Fig 21b. The smoothness of the curve can also be controlled using the slider. We can also log important files or scripts in our project to MlFlow using the mlflow.log_artifact command . Fig 22a shows how to use it in your training script and Fig 22b shows how it is displayed on the mlflow dashboard. MlFlow also allows users to compare two runs simultaneously and generate plots for it. Just tick the check-boxes against the runs you want to compare and press on the blue Compare button (Fig 23) Once you click on compare, another page pops up where all metrics and parameters of two different runs can be viewed and studied in parallel (Fig 24a) The user can also choose to display metrics such as accuracy and loss in parallel charts as shown in Fig 24b. Users can add an MlFlow Project file (a text file in YAML syntax) to their MlFlow project allowing them to package their code better and run and recreate results from any machine. The MlFlow Project file for our fashion_mnsit project looks as shown below in Fig 25a We can also specify a conda environment for our MlFlow project and specify a conda.yaml file (Fig 25b). Hence, with this we conclude our project. Developers face several on-demand requirements for monitoring metrics during training a neural network. These metrics can be extremely critical for predicting the output of their neural networks and are also critical in understanding how to modify a neural network for better performance. Traditionally when starting off with deep learning experiments, many developers are unaware of proper tools to help them. I hope this was piece of writing was helpful in understanding how deep learning experiments can be conducted in a proper manner during production when large numbers of datasets are needed to be managed and multiple training and evaluation instances are required to be monitored. MlFlow also has multiple other features which is beyond the scope of this tutorial and can be covered later.

Having multiple smaller modules have a few distinctadvantages Build times are noticeably faster Your code is decoupled with clear dependencies Better distribution of ownership across different parts of the app Allows modules to be reused across apps Example modulesA possible strategy is to have one module per feature. app: This is the main module which will be the entry point into your app. It acts mainly as a coordinator betweenother modules core: This will contain the model definitions that are core to your app and will be required across modules networking: This provides the networking code for the other modules login: Login/Signup logic goes here dashboard: User dashboard will be here There are many posts on the advantages and strategies for modularizing your Android apps. For this post, we willfocus on the strategy to reuse modules across apps. Reusing modules across appsWe have multiple apps in our company that share the core and login logic. So we decided to share these modules amongthe two applications. One obvious way to share Android Library modules would be to share the generated .aar files and add them asdependencies to the different apps. While this is simpler, the main applications and the library modules will bedifferent Android Studio projects. If any change needs to be done in the library, the .aar will have to be regeneratedand manually updated. There has to be a better way. The solution we decided to use for sharing modules is git submodules. Though it had a small overhead in bringingthe entire team up to speed with submodules, it has worked exceptionally well for us. In the above example, we have two git submodules, core and login. And the submodules will be added as dependencies just as any Android module, Creating a new submodulesTo create a new submodule, we follow the following process Create an empty repo on Github and initialize with a README Add a new submodule to our app git submodule add git@github.com:username/core.git Create a new Android Library module in the new directory Commit the changes in the library module and push Commit the changes in the main repo and push Next time we need to use this submodule in another app, we only need to Add a new submodule to our app git submodule add git@github.com:username/core.git Add the newly added module to settings.gradle and a dependency in build.gradle Committing changes to a submoduleEvery time we make some changes to a submodule, we just need to make sure that we commit and push those changesbefore committing the changes in the main repo. Submodule: If you are on a detached head, git checkout -b new-branch git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -am &quot;commit message&quot; git push origin new-branch Main repo: git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -am &quot;commit message&quot; git push Fetching remote changesEvery time we do a git pull, we just need to remember to update the submodules as well git submodule update and that’s it. We have the latest version of the submodule locally! Hope this works for you.

In this post, we will apply variedpreprocessing techniques to the input image and find out how to localize text in theenhanced image, so that we can feed the segments to our text recognition network. Image PreprocessingSometimes images can be distorted, noisy and other problems that can scale back the OCRaccuracy. To make a better OCR pipeline, we need to do some image preprocessing. Grayscale the image: Generally you will get an image which is having 3channels(color images), we need to convert this image into a grayscale form whichcontains only one channel. We can also process images with three channels but itonly increases the complexity of the model and increases the processing time.OpenCV provides a built-in function that can do it for you. 12import cv2grayscale_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BRG2GRAY) Or you can convert the image to grayscale while reading the image. 12#opencv reads image in BGR formatgraysacle_image = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE) Noise reduction: Images come with various types of noises. OpenCV provides a lot ofnoise reduction function. I am using the Non-local Means Denoising algorithm. 1denoised_image = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(grayscale_img, None, 10, 7, 21) Contrast adjustment: Sometimes we have low contrast images. This makes it difficultto separate text from the image background. We need high contrast text images forthe localization process. We can increase image contrast using Contrast LimitedAdaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) among many other contrast enhancementmethods provided by skimage. 12from skimage import exposurecontrast_enhanced_image = exposure.equalize_adapthist(denoised, clip_limit=0.03) So now we are done with image preprocessing let us move on to the second part, textlocalization. Text LocalizationIn this part, we will see how to detect a large number of text region candidates andprogressively removes those less likely to contain text. Using the MSER feature descriptor tofind text candidates in the image. It works well for text because the consistent color and highcontrast of text lead to stable intensity profiles. 123#constructor for MSER detectormser = cv2.MSER_create()regions, mser_bboxes = mser.detectRegions(contrast_enhance_image) Along with the text MSER picked up many other stable regions that are not text. Now, thegeometric properties of text can be used to filter out non-text regions using simplethresholds. Before moving on with the filtering process, let’s write some functions to display the results ina comprehensible manner. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt#display imagesdef pltShow(*images): #count number of images to show count = len(images) #three images per columnn Row = np.ceil(count / 3.) for i in range(count): plt.subplot(nRow, 3, i+1) if len(images[i][0], cmap=’gray’) plt.imshow(images[i][0], cmap=’gray’) else: plt.imshow(images[i][0]) #remove x-y axis from subplots plt.xticks([]) plt.yticks([]) plt.title(images[i][1]) plt.show()#color each MSER region in imagedef colorRegion(image_like_arr, region): image_like_arr[region[:, 1], region[:, 0], 0] = np.random.randint(low=100, high=256) image_like_arr[region[:, 1], region[:, 0], 1] = np.random.randint(low=100, high=256) image_like_arr[region[:, 1], region[:, 0], 2] = np.random.randint(low=100, high=256) return image The geometric properties we are going to use to discriminate between text and non-textregion are: Region area Region perimeter Aspect ratio Occupancy Compactness We will apply simple thresholds over these parameters to eliminate non-text regions. Firstlet’s write method to compute these parameters. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031#values for the parametersAREA_LIM = 2.0e-4PERIMETER_LIM = 1e-4ASPECT_RATIO_LIM = 5.0OCCUPATION_LIM = (0.23, 0.90)COMPACTNESS_LIM = (3e-3, 1e-1)def getRegionShape(self, region): return (max(region[:, 1]) - min(region[:, 1]), max(region[:, 0]) - min(region[:, 0])) #compute areadef getRegionArea(region): return len(list(region))#compute perimeterdef getRegionPerimeter(image, region): #get top-left coordinate, width and height of the box enclosing the region x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(region) return len(np.where(image[y:y+h, x:x+w] != 0)[0])) #compute aspect ratiodef getAspectRatio(region): return (1.0 * max(getRegionShape(region))) / (min(getRegionShape(region)) + 1e-4)#compute area occupied by the region area in the shapedef getOccupyRate(region): return (1.0 * getRegionArea(region)) / (getRegionShape(region)[0] * \\getRegionShape(region)[1] + 1.0e-10) #compute compactness of the regiondef getCompactness(region): return (1.0 * getRegionArea(region)) / (1.0 * getRegionPerimeter(region) ** 2) Now apply these methods to filter out text regions as follows: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930#total number of MSER regionsn1 = len(regions)bboxes=[]for i, region in enumerate(regions): self.colorRegion(res, region) if self.getRegionArea(region) &gt; self.grayImg.shape[0] * self.grayImg.shape[1] * AREA_LIM: #number of regions meeting the area criteria n2 += 1 self.colorRegion(res2, region) if self.getRegionPerimeter(region) &gt; 2 * (self.grayImg.shape[0] + \\ self.grayImg.shape[1]) * PERIMETER_LIM: #number of regions meeting the perimeter criteria n3 += 1 self.colorRegion(res3, region) if self.getAspectRatio(region) &lt; ASPECT_RATIO_LIM: #number of regions meeting the aspect ratio criteria n4 += 1 self.colorRegion(res4, region) if (self.getOccupyRate(region) &gt; OCCUPATION_LIM[0]) and \\ (self.getOccupyRate(region) &lt; OCCUPATION_LIM[1]): n5 += 1 self.colorRegion(res5, region) if (self.getCompactness(region) &gt; \\COMPACTNESS_LIM[0]) and \\(self.getCompactness(region) &lt; \\COMPACTNESS_LIM[1]): #final number of regions left n6 += 1 self.colorRegion(res6, region) bboxes.append(mser_bboxes[i]) After eliminating non-text regions, I draw bounding boxes on the remaining regions andvoila, we have successfully detected and segmented the characters on the number plate.Note: Apply NMS to remove overlapping bounding boxes. 12for bbox in bboxes: cv2.rectangle(img,(bbox[0]-1,bbox[1]-1),(bbox[0]+bbox[2]+1,box[1]+bbox[3]+1),(255,0,0), 1) Enough coding.
